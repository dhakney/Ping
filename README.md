# Ping is a social media App
📸 Drop a Snap. Let the World Discover It.
Snap a photo or video, pin it to a location, and leave it behind for your friends to find when they’re nearby. Whether it’s a surprise message, a funny memory, or a hidden recommendation, your Snap stays locked until the right moment.

🗺️ Location-Based Magic
Your friends get a notification only when they’re close enough to where you left your Snap. It’s like digital treasure hunting — but more personal.

🎭 Surprise Them — or Tease Them
Send a teaser to let your friends know there’s something waiting, or keep it a complete mystery until they walk into the right spot.

💡 What Can You Share?
• Love notes waiting at your partner’s favorite place
• Travel tips left behind for future explorers
• Secret shout-outs in the school hallway
• That hilarious selfie from last night’s hangout spot

👥 Friends or Groups — You Choose
Share Snap privately with friends or post them in groups to connect with people who share your interests, wherever you go.

💬 Chat About the Moments You Uncover
Use built-in messaging to talk about your favorite Snaps, guess what a teaser might be, or react to a surprise drop.

🌍 Turn places into stories.
Create real-world memories your friends can unlock just by being there.
